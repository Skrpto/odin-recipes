    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Beef stir-fry is a quick and flavorful dish that combines tender strips of beef with vibrant vegetables and a savory sauce. The beef is often marinated in a mixture of soy sauce, garlic, and ginger to enhance its flavor and tenderness before being quickly cooked over high heat. This dish is typically served over steamed rice or noodles, making it a versatile meal that is both satisfying and easy to prepare, perfect for weeknight dinners.</p>

    <p>The key to a great stir-fry is preparing all ingredients in advance, as the cooking process happens quickly. High heat and a short cooking time ensure the beef remains tender and the vegetables retain their crispness. The sauce, which often includes soy sauce, oyster sauce, and a touch of sesame oil, brings everything together with a rich, umami flavor. This makes beef stir-fry a go-to dish for those seeking a healthy and delicious meal in minimal time.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1 lb beef sirloin, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup broccoli florets</li>
        <li>1 carrot, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger, grated</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce (for sauce)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water or beef broth</li>
        <li>Cooked rice, for serving</li>
        <li>Sesame seeds, for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine the sliced beef with 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and cornstarch. Mix well and let it marinate for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over high heat. Add the marinated beef in a single layer and cook for 2-3 minutes until browned. Remove the beef from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, add the bell pepper, broccoli, and carrot. Stir-fry the vegetables for 3-4 minutes until they are tender-crisp.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and grated ginger to the skillet, stirring for 1 minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Return the beef to the skillet along with the vegetables. Add the soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, and water or beef broth, stirring to combine.</li>
        <li>Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken and coat the beef and vegetables evenly.</li>
