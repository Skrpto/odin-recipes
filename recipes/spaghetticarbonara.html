    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Spaghetti Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish made with eggs, cheese, pancetta, and pepper. It is known for its creamy, rich sauce created without the use of heavy cream. The dish is traditionally made with guanciale (cured pork cheek), but pancetta or bacon can also be used. Carbonara is loved for its simplicity and the way the silky sauce clings to the pasta, delivering a satisfying and indulgent meal with just a few ingredients.</p>

    <p>This dish is best served fresh, as the sauce can become too thick if reheated. To achieve the perfect consistency, it is important to toss the pasta in the sauce over low heat, allowing the heat from the pasta to gently cook the eggs and cheese without scrambling them. This technique results in a smooth, creamy sauce that makes Spaghetti Carbonara a beloved staple in Italian cuisine and a favorite comfort food around the world.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>200g spaghetti</li>
        <li>100g pancetta or bacon, diced</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish, optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Cook the spaghetti in a large pot of salted boiling water according to the package instructions until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta water, then drain the spaghetti.</li>
        <li>While the pasta cooks, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the pancetta or bacon and cook until it is crispy, about 5-7 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs and grated Parmesan cheese. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked spaghetti to the skillet with the pancetta, tossing to coat the pasta with the oil and pancetta. Remove the skillet from heat.</li>
        <li>Quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta, tossing quickly to combine. The heat from the pasta will cook the eggs, creating a creamy sauce. Add a splash of reserved pasta water if the sauce is too thick.</li>
        <li>Season generously with freshly ground black pepper and salt to taste. Garnish with chopped parsley, if using.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately, topped with extra Parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
    </ol>
